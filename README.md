**Run project**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`
